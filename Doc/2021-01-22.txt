*******************************PHP*********************************
- PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocesso).
- PHP is a server scripting language, and a powerful tool for making dynamic and interactive Web pages.

* echo and print statement
- echo and print are more or less the same. They are both used to output data to the screen.
- The differences are small: echo has no return value while print has a return value of 1 so it can be used in expressions. echo can take multiple parameters (although such usage is rare) while print can take one argument. echo is marginally faster than print.

*Comments
-  // This is a single-line comment.
-  # This is also a single-line comment.
-  /* This is a multiple-lines comment block */

* Variable
- Variables are "containers" for storing information.In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable: $text = "Hello world!";

* Concatenation
- Concatenation operator (‘.‘), which returns the concatenation of its right and left arguments.

* if else
- if statement - executes some code if one condition is true.
- if...else statement : executes some code if a condition is true and another code if that condition is false.
- if...elseif...else statement - executes different codes for more than two conditions.
- Syntax :if (condition) {
  		code to be executed if this condition is true;
	} elseif (condition) {
		  code to be executed if first condition is false and this condition is true;
	} else {
		  code to be executed if all conditions are false;
	}

*Arithmetic Operator
- The PHP arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common arithmetical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.
- Operator : Addition ( + ) , Subtraction ( - ) , Multiplication ( * ) , Division ( \ ) , Modulus (% ) , Exponentiation ( ** ).

*Assignment Operator
- Assignment operator in PHP is "=". It means that the left operand gets set to the value of the assignment expression on the right.

* Comparision Operator
- The PHP comparison operators are used to compare two values (number or string).
- Operator : Equal (==) , Identical (===) , Not Equal ( != ) , Not Equal (<> ) , Not identical ( !== ) , Greater than ( > ) , Less than ( < ), Greater than or equal to ( >= ) , Less than or equal to ( <= ) , Spaceship ( <=> ).

* Logical Operator
- The PHP logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.
- Operators : And (&&,and) , Or ( || , or ) , Xor (xor) , Not ( ! ).

* while loop and do..while loop 
- while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true
- Syntax : while (condition is true) {
  	code to be executed;
	}
- Syntax :  do {
	  code to be executed;
	} while (condition is true);

* for loop
- The for loop - Loops through a block of code a specified number of times.
- Syntax : for (init counter; test counter; increment counter) {
  	code to be executed for each iteration;
	}
- Parameters:
	init counter: Initialize the loop counter value.
	test counter: Evaluated for each loop iteration. If it evaluates to TRUE, the loop.		continues. If it evaluates to FALSE, the loop ends.
	increment counter: Increases the loop counter value.

* switch 
- Use the switch statement to select one of many blocks of code to be executed.
- Syntax : switch (n) {
  	case label1:
	    code to be executed if n=label1;
	    break;
	case label2:
	    code to be executed if n=label2;
	    break;
	case label3:
	    code to be executed if n=label3;
	    break;
	    ...
	default:
	    code to be executed if n is different from all labels;
	}
