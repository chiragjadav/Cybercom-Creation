* Primitve Values and Object References
- Primitive values: Primitives are known as being immutable data types because there is no way to   change a primitive value once it gets created.
- Number, Strings, Booleans, Undefined, null
- Create Copy of value.

- Object References : Non-primitive values are mutable data types. The value of an object can be   changed after it gets created.
- Array, Functions, Objects, Dates, Wrapper for Numbers,Strings,Booleans.
- Create Reference Of object.

* Obb Programming
- Objects interacting with one another through methods and properties.
  Used to store data, structure application into modules and keeping code clean.
- Everthing object has prototype property which makes inheritance possible in js.
- The prototype property of an object is where we put methods and properties that we want
  other object to inherit.
- The constructor's prototype property is NOT the prototype of the constructore itself, it's the   prototype of ALL instance that are created through it.
- When a certain ,method (or property ) is called, the search starts in the object itself,and of it 
  cannot be found. The search moves on to the object's prototype. This continues until the method   is found: Prototype Chain.

* Functions
- Function is an instance of the object type.
- Function be like any other object.
- We can store functions in a variable.
- We can pass function as an argument to another function.
- We can return a function from a function.

- These are the brief summary of what I have Learned today from video lectures.
