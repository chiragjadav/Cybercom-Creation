*Array 
- An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
- In PHP, the array() function is used to create an array: 
- Syntax : array();
- In PHP, there are three types of arrays:
- Indexed arrays : Arrays with a numeric index.
- Associative arrays : Associative arrays are arrays that use named keys that you assign to 	them.
- Example : $age = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37", "Joe"=>"43");
- Multidimensional arrays : A two-dimensional array is an array of arrays (a three-dimensional array 		        is an array of arrays of arrays).
- Example : //Multidimentional Array
	$food = array('Healthy'=>
	             array('Salad','Vegetables','Pasta'),
	             'Unhealthy'=>
	             array('Pizza','Ice cream'));


*include and require
- To insert the content of one PHP file into another PHP file (before the server executes it), with the include or require statement.
- The include and require statements are identical, except upon failure:
- require: will produce a fatal error (E_COMPILE_ERROR) and stop the script
- include: will only produce a warning (E_WARNING) and the script will continue
- The include_once() statement can be used to include a php file in another one, when you may need to include the called file more than once. If it is found that the file has already been included, calling script is going to ignore further inclusions.
- require_once() statement can be used to include a php file in another one, when you may need to include the called file more than once. If it is found that the file has already been included, calling script is going to ignore further inclusions.

*String Function

- strtolower() : The strtolower() function converts a string to lowercase.
- strtoupper() : The strtoupper() function converts a string to uppercase.
