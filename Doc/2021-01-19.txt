******************************Java Script**************************************
* Classes : ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced JavaScript Classes.JavaScript Classes   are templates for JavaScript Objects.
- Class methods are created with the same syntax as object methods.Use the keyword class to create a class.
- Always add a constructor() method.Then add any number of methods.
- Syntax : class ClassName {
  constructor() { ... }
  method_1() { ... }
}
 
- The constructor method is called automatically when a new object is created.If we do not define a constructor method, JavaScript will add an empty constructor method.

* Subclass and Superclass : In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:
- subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
- superclass (parent) - the class being inherited fromTo inherit from a class, use the extends keyword.
