**************************************PHP***********************************
* Exception 
- Exception handling is used to change the normal flow of the code execution if a specified error (exceptional) condition occurs. This condition is called an exception.
- To handle exceptio we use try,catch and throw.
- try : A function using an exception should be in a "try" block. If the exception does not trigger, the code will continue as normal. However if the exception triggers, an exception is "thrown.
- throw : This is how you trigger an exception. Each "throw" must have at least one "catch".
- catch : A "catch" block retrieves an exception and creates an object containing the exception information.
- $e->getMessage function is used to get error message.
- There are following functions which can be used from Exception class.
	- getMessage() => message of exception.
	- getCode() => code of exception.
	- getFile() => source filename.
	- getLine() => source line.
	- getTrace() => n array of the backtrace().
	- getTraceAsString() => formated string of trace.

* Custom Exception class
- The custom exception class inherits the properties from PHP's exception class and you can add custom functions to it.
- Syntax :  class customException extends Exception {}.

* OOP concept in php
- Class : This is a programmer-defined data type, which includes local functions as well as local data.
- Object : An individual instance of the data structure defined by a class. You define a class once and then make many objects that belong to it. Objects are also known as instance.
- Constructor : refers to a special type of function which will be called automatically whenever there is an object formation from a class.
- Syntax to create constructor : public function __classname(){}.
- To access the instance of class we use $this->.
- A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. The value cannot be changed during the script.
-Scope Resolution Operator (::) : The Scope Resolution Operator the double colon, is a token that allows access to static, constant, and overridden properties or methods of a class.

* Access Modifiers
- public : the property or method can be accessed from everywhere. This is default.
- protected : the property or method can be accessed within the class and by classes derived from that class.
- private : the property or method can ONLY be accessed within the class.

- connected database using oop concept.
