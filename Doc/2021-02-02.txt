- RIGHT JOIN : The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table (table2), and the matched records from the left table (table1). The result is NULL from the left side, when there is no match.
- Syntax : SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1 RIGHT JOIN table2 ON table1.column_name =   table2.column_name;

- JOIN : The FULL OUTER JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in left (table1) or right (table2) table records.
